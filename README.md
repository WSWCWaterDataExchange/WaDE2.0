## FAQ
**How to import data into the database, locally?**

(For a more detailed step by step process go here: https://github.com/WSWCWaterDataExchange/WaDE2.0/tree/develop/source)
1. Head to the [source repo](https://github.com/WSWCWaterDataExchange/WaDE2.0) and clone it with the VS.
   * Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
   * In the Clone with HTTPs section, click the copy icon to copy the clone URL for the repository.
   * Open Git Bash.
   * Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
   * Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied.
   * Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

2.	Download and install [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/).
3.	Download and install [Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator).
4.	In the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer window, head to the Storage Accounts/local-1 (key)/Blob Containers/normalizedimports and then the folder which is related to the import data.
5.	Make sure that the Csv file fields are in a good format. 
   * Check if the Csv file fields order, matches the order of the fields in the related type table. 
   * To check this, open the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, head to the Databases/WaDE2/programmability/Types/User-Defined Table Types and check the related table type.
   * Make sure that the foreign key relationships are holding (if a value which is a foreign key, is going to be inserted, make sure it exists in the reference table as well).

6.	If you want to add a new Csv file, you can upload it through the Explorer window.
7.	Load the startup section of VS with WaDEImportFunctions and run it.
8.	Open a browser tab.
9.	Type http://localhost:7071/api/LoadWaterAllocationData?runid=   
10.	After the equal sign, type the name of the folder which the csv file exists inside, in the explorer window.
11.	press enter.
12.	The import function should run successfully.
